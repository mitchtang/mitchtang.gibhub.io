This paper estimates the effect of physician agency on physicians' prescription choices. The data consist of millions of prescriptions for diabetes patients in Taiwan, which is unique because Taiwan adopts a universal healthcare system and allows physicians to both prescribe and dispense drugs. A structural discrete choice model was applied and accounted for physician heterogeneity in their agency. The results show that physician-owners in private institutions were more likely to prescribe generic drugs or the drugs with higher markups. Empirical results also show that the demand of a drug increases with its markup. Counterfactual analysis shows that the size of agency problem could in between 1% to 3% of the total expenditure in the outpatient services for diabetes patients in Taiwan, or an amount between $11,250,695 to $36,400,000.
