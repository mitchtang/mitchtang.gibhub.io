This paper estimates the effect of physician agency on physiciansâ€™ prescription choices. The data consist of millions of prescriptions for diabetes patients in Taiwan, which is unique because Taiwan adopts a universal healthcare system and allows physicians to both prescribe and dispense drugs. Physician agency was proxied by the average markup of a drug that was recovered from the regulation pricing formula, and it is allowed to be endogenous in the estimation. A structural discrete choice model was applied and accounted for physician heterogeneity in their agency. The results show that physician-owners in private institutions were more likely to prescribe the drugs with higher markups. Empirical results also show that the demand of a drug increases with its markup. Counterfactual analysis shows that the size of agency could be as much as about 10% of the total expenditure, or an amount of $15,394,166.
