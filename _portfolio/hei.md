This paper empirically identifies physicians’ supply curve in a universal healthcare system that has a fixed budget and a retrospective price adjustment mechanism. Benstetter and Wambach’s (Journal of Health Economics, 2006) theory predicts multiple equilibria under such a system, where physicians’ supply curve could be either positive or negative sloping. This paper extends their theory to empirically identify physicians’ supply curve with an exogenous shifted budget. Using the population data of medical providers’ services under universal health insurance coverage in Taiwan, empirical evidence shows that the dentists and Chinese herb practitioners maintained positive sloping supply curves. Hospitals and clinics that practice Western medicine were found to have negative sloping supply curves. The latter results indicate medical providers have incentives to provide excessive services under global budgeting, even when this drives down the price of their services provided.
