This paper investigates the determinants of intergenerational patrilocal coresidence choices in Taiwan. Our rich dataset allows us to control for the characteristics of husbands and wives, as well as parents and children, across three generations in the analysis. Using nonlinear panel data methods to control for the unobserved, time-invariant factors within households, we found that both parents' and children's years of education are negatively related with the probability of patrilocal coresidence. We also found that the parents with experience from patrilocal coresidence are less likely to live with their children. Empirical results also show that the wives who lived with their husbands' parents earned more salary and shared more household chores than the others. These expected burdens from patrilocal coresidence might deter women's willingness to enter marriage.
