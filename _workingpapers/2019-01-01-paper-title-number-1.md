The markup from prescription drugs may affect physicians’ generic pharmaceutical adoption choices, but this information is rarely available. In this paper, we retrieved the average markup of each drug from the reimbursement pricing history in Taiwan. While we did not
observe individual markups, we accounted for the retrieved markup as measured with error
in the estimation. We found that a three-cent increase of the markup differential between

generic and branded drugs would increase the likelihood of physicians’ generic pharmaceutical adoptions by about 10%. We inferred that private clinics are likely to have the largest markup differential among all the providers.
