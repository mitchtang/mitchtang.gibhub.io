This study empirically tests how expected surplus and specific investments affect the
structure of National Football League player contracts. Empirical results show that both
length and monetary compensations of a player’s contract increase with expected
surplus and specific investments. In particular, early draftees with higher expected value
of future performance signed longer and more lucrative contracts than later draftees
did. This correlation is affected by a team’s expected surplus from contracting with their
draftees. Comparing to the other teams, teams with more empty seats and fewer wins
in the previous season invested more in early draftees, but less in later draftees. The
results also indicate that players requiring more specific investments negotiated longer
and more lucrative contracts than did other players, particularly quarterbacks.
