In this paper, we prove for the first time that a demand ad valorem tax on commodity
price is equivalent to the cost payment tax in the two-part tariff model if such a tax is imposed
on both admission charge and user’s fee. The same result is found in the third-degree price
discrimination model. However, this property is not preserved in the rate-of-return-regulated
monopoly model. It relates to the importance of the choice of tax policies not only in a pure
monopoly, but also in two-part tariff, third-degree price discrimination and regulated
monopoly models.
